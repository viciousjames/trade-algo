# final-algo.py code was used in the final year trading algorithm and strategies class with this code coming out in the top 4% of the class in terms on consistent profit over 10 rounds of 15 minute trading on a simulated market. This code also inspired python based solutions for the trading competition with the Investment Society (IS) at UTSC, coming first after 10 rounds of competition. 
# predictive-algo.py was used in the same class for our final project and traded based off of news that was generated from the volatile simulated market. 
# Both codes use the API and real time information and the code is designed to make trades on the Rotman RIT Simulator which is used to host cross-campus and nationwide competitions in trading.
